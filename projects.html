    <p>Here some of the projects I participated in are listed.</p>

    <h2>Project: Voicebot for sociological studies</h2>
    <p>In the last decade artificial intelligence (AI) has
      greatly evolved due to the combination of neural networks and
      increased computational power. This has led to a variety of
      new AI applications like chat- and voicebots. Even though such
      applications have become increasingly visible, the moral impacts
      they have on humans are relatively unknown. The analysis of
      these impacts is an emerging research field in sociology and
      psychology. Researchers therefore need easy-to-use chat- and
      voicebots to carry out their experiments. The frameworks and
      applications needed for such bots should be open-source and free
      to use under a public licence so that the approaches can be shared
      freely among researchers and be further developed.
      In this paper, we develop a chatbot with voice support using
      only open-source frameworks with public licences. It is used in a
      social experiment about moral decisions to prove its applicability
      to real world experiments. Our framework is capable of detecting
      and processing speech in an online manner with a latency below
      one second.</p>

    <h2>Project: Local Error Signals</h2>
    <p>In the recent boom of Deep Learning, Backpropa-
      gation of error has become the dominant method for optimizing
      Deep Neural Networks and is the only optimization method that
      is widely applied in the field. It has been argued however, that
      the brain, which has initially inspired some of the development of
      DNNs, is biologically unable to optimize networks in such a global
      way. Therefore, many training methods have been suggested, in
      which a loss and the subsequent weight optimization is calculated
      at the level of each individual layer. This raises the question, of
      whether these networks learn representations in their layers with
      similar properties to Backpropagation trained networks.
      In this work, two of these local loss methods, the Prediction
      Similarity loss and the Direct Difference Target Propagation loss
      have been used to train simple convolutional neural networks and
      these networks have been compared to their Backpropagation
      trained counterparts in terms of accuracies and layer-wise data
      representation.
      Our results give some initial evidence towards the assumption
      that the Prediction Similarity loss might be a training method
      that is able to approximate Backpropagation both in terms of
      performance as well as layer-wise data representations. Direct
      Difference Target Propagation however did not perform well
      with convolutional models and therefore no statements about its
      similarity to Backpropagation can be made.</p>

    <h2>Master Thesis: Hypernetworks: Generating Neural Networks with Neural Networks</h2>
    <p>In reinforcement learning (RL) gradient based methods have shown to efficiently master many
      games in a superhuman manner. New advances in meta learning aim to improve these playing
      agents in terms of sample efficiency by introducing new methods of ’learning how to learn’.
      They also try to enhance the adaptation capabilities of the agents to quickly changing and
      diverse playing styles of their opponents. To study and evaluate these approaches, a diverse
      set of agents is needed.
      In this work hypernetworks will be evaluated as a method to create a diverse set of agents.
      Hypernetworks are neural networks that generate weights for another neural network. They
      can be used in a similar fashion as variational autoencoders (VAEs) or generative adversarial
      networks (GANs) to generate a mapping from a low dimensional (random) input vector to high
      dimensional weight space. The loss function of such a hypernetwork contains two properties:
      accuracy and diversity. The latter is used to ensure that the network generates a distribution of
      agents.
      The approach is bench marked against individually trained agents as well as an evolution-
      ary method, where the selection criterion consists also of both, an accuracy and a diversity
      term. The different approaches are tested on an image classification task, a graph game and an
      imperfect information card game.</p>

    <h2>Project: Machine Learning Turtle Bot</h2>

    <p>This project has been carried out as part of the Industrial Distributed Control Systems
      project module under the Department of Industry Grade Networks and Clouds in the  
      Faculty for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (IV) at the Technical University of Berlin. 
      This project attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of using a Deep
      Reinforcement Learning algorithm such as Deep Q Networks (DQN) for Autonomous
      Navigation using the latest Open Source Techstack available such as ROS2, gazebo9,
      and turtlebot3 Machine Learning packages (Keras and Tensorflow). It lays out the various processes 
      that were followed to install, setup the code, and discusses any limitations
      faced in the process. The packages used are studied for their scalability and flexibility to tweak the 
      various parameters and functions, and thereby enhance the learning
      capabilities of the model. The training process was conducted on the DQN model in
      two different simulation environments, solely relying on Laser Distance Sensor data for
      navigation. The results recorded show successful navigation attempts in a relatively low
      number of episodes and includes several observations regarding how the various parameters chosen,
      affect the training outcomes. The scope of modifying these values and
      extended training and simulation capabilities have been briefly explored in the report.</p>
